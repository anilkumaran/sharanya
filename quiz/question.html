                100: {
                    question: `What is the meaning of Ramayan ?`,
                    answer: `
Rama + ayana - means the Journey of Ramachandra (His walk of Life)

Ramaa + ayana - The Life of Sita. 

Ramaa + ayana  - Life of the people who are related to Rama. 

All the characters of Rama from a small Vanara to Ayodhya King Dasaratha, belong to Rama. So it's the life history of each and every one related to Rama
                ` },
                101: {
                    question: `Is Ramayana a Mythology ?`,
                    answer: `
Mythology means - collection of myths or stories about a specific person, culture etc.
Ramayan is not a mythology - It is called itihāsa. The meaning of word itihāsa is "It happened like this". Means Ramayana is the compilation of historical facts.
Similarly Mahabharath is another itihāsa. 

Hence, all our scriptures can be called as itihāsas or history and not mythology. The english word "History" has its roots in "itihāsa"
                ` },
                102: {
                    question: `Who documented Ramayana ?
Why the word "documented" is used instead of the word "written" ? `,
                    answer: `
Valmiki documented the Ramayana.

Valmiki got a special blessing from Lord Brahma. This blessing allowed him to see and understand everything that happened in the Ramayana, including the thoughts and actions of all the characters. So, Valmiki did not imagine the story. He just wrote down what truly happened. We say Valmiki "documented" the Ramayana instead of "wrote" because he recorded the true events he saw, rather than creating a story from his imagination.

Lord Brahma also blessed Valmiki that as long as there are mountains and rivers on Earth, the Ramayana he documented would always exist.
                `},
                103: {
                    question: `What is the story of Valmiki ?
What are the learning outcomes from his life ?`,
                    answer: `
Valmiki was originally a man named Ruksha. 

He meditated on the Lord's name and did tapasya (deep prayer and penance) for many thousands of years. 

During this time, an anthill grew around him. When it rained, the anthill melted, and he came out. 

Because he emerged from the anthill, which is called "Valmeekam" in Sanskrit, he was given the name Valmiki.

We can summarise the learnings from Valmiki's life...in one sentence -
"Krushi vunte Manushulu rushulu avutaru"
"కృషి ఉంటే మనుషులు ఋషులు అవుతారు"
                `},
                104: {
                    question: `Who is the teacher of Rama ?`,
                    answer: `
Sage Vasishta and Sage Vishwamitra are his teachers.

During his time in the forests, he learned many things from different sages living there.

Rama is the Supreme Lord in human form. Even God is showing us how important it is to learn from teachers.
                `},
                105: {
                    question: `What is the meaning of the word - Rama and what are the other names of Rama ?`,
                    answer: `
The meaning of the Rama is the one who gives pleasure

Other names of Rama are 

Kausalya Tanaya - Son of Kausalya
Raghava - Belongs to the Raghu dynasty
Dasaratha Nandana - Son of Dasaratha
Kodanda Rama - His bow's name is Kodanda
Sita Pati - Husband of Sita Devi

                108: {
                    question: `What is the size (Kandas) of the Ramayana ?`,
                    answer: `
The Ramayana has 7 Kandas (parts):

Bala Kanda
Ayodhya Kanda
Aranya Kanda
Kishkinda Kanda
Sundara Kanda
Yuddha Kanda
Uttara Kanda
It contains more than 500 sargas (chapters) and 24,000 slokas (verses).

                200: {
                    question: `What is Bhagavad Gita ?`,
                    answer: `
"Gita" means song, and "Bhagavat" means Lord Krishna. The Bhagavad Gita is a song of God spoken by Lord Krishna to Arjuna. It is like a manual for living a meaningful and successful life, so it is important for all of us to learn the Gita.

The Bhagavad Gita has 18 chapters and 700 shloka (verses).

                    question: `Arjuna was not the first one to hear Bhagavad Gita . Millions of years prior Lord Krishna gave this knowledge of Gita to Sun God!  Where is this fact told in Bhagavad Gita ?`,
                    answer: `
Lord Krishna says this in Chapter 4, Shloka 1 of Gita

imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ
proktavān aham avyayam
vivasvān manave prāha
manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt

Here Lord says that "Long ago, I shared this special knowledge with the Sun God, Vivasvān. He then shared it with Manu, who is the father of all people. Manu passed it onto Ikṣvāku"
                `},
                202: {
                    question: `When Bhagavad Gita was already spoke to Sun God long ago and it was being passed on for generations, why did Lord Krishna give this knowledge again to Arjuna ?`,
                    answer: `
Lord Krishna says this in Chapter 4, Shloka 2 of Gita

evaṁ paramparā-prāptam
imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ
sa kāleneha mahatā
yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa

Here Lord tells Arjuna that "Along though I already gave this knowledge to Sun God long ago, over time, the true purpose of this special knowledge was lost. That's why I am now sharing this important knowledge with you again."
                `},
                203: {
                    question: `Where does Lord Krishna say that he has chosen Arjuna for giving this knowledge of Gita - because Arjuna was his devotee and Friend`,
                    answer: `
Lord Krishna says this in Chapter 4, Shloka 3 of Gita

sa evāyaṁ mayā te 'dya
yogaḥ proktaḥ purātanaḥ
bhakto 'si me sakhā ceti
rahasyaṁ hy etad uttamam

Here Lord tells Arjuna that
"You are my devotee and friend, I am sharing this divine mystery"
